EduceLab-Scrolls is a comprehensive open dataset representing two decades of research effort on the challenge of noninvasively reading the Herculaneum scrolls.

EduceLab-Scrolls contains a set of volumetric X-ray CT images, of both small fragments and intact, rolled scrolls.
The dataset also contains 2D image labels, used in the supervised training of an ink detection model.

Using EduceLab-Scrolls we have revealed, for the first time, hidden characters from the interior layers of Herculaneum papyri.

A subset of EduceLab-Scrolls is now available through Vesuvius Challenge, a machine learning and computer vision competition to build on this work and recover more text from the Herculaneum papyri.
